Logger

This sub-module is part of the [fourtwentycoins project](https://github.com/420integrated/fourtwentycoins.js).

It is responsible for managing logging and errors to maintain a standard
structure.

Importing

Most users will prefer to use the [umbrella package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fourtwentycoins ),
but for those with more specific needs, individual components can be imported.

```javascript
const {

    Logger,

    // Enums

    ErrorCode,

    LogLevel,

} = require("@420integrated/logger");
